## Founder Image Upload Instructions

### Current Status:
- The uploaded files `IMG-20250419-WA0161` and `founder` are not accessible in the workspace
- The About page is ready with a placeholder for Fortune Iretiosa Uwoghiren's image
- All code is prepared to display the founder image correctly

### Solution Options:

#### Option 1: Direct File Upload (Recommended)
1. Save your founder image as `fortune-founder.jpg`
2. Upload it directly to: `/workspace/ftg_designmatch/public/images/`
3. The image will be automatically available at: `./images/fortune-founder.jpg`

#### Option 2: Use the Upload Utility
1. Visit: https://hmhkpe5bqc.skywork.website/image-upload
2. Select your founder image file
3. Follow the step-by-step instructions provided

#### Option 3: Replace Existing Placeholder
1. Replace the existing `founder-fortune_1.jpeg` with your actual image
2. Keep the same filename to avoid code changes
3. The image will appear immediately

### Code Update Needed:
Once the image is uploaded, update line 97 in `/src/pages/About.tsx`:

```jsx
// Replace this placeholder:
<div className="w-full h-full bg-gradient-to-br from-primary/20 to-primary/5 rounded-2xl flex items-center justify-center border-4 border-primary/20">
  <div className="text-center px-4">
    <User className="h-16 w-16 sm:h-20 sm:w-20 md:h-24 md:w-24 text-primary/60 mx-auto mb-4" />
    <p className="text-xs sm:text-sm text-muted-foreground">Fortune Iretiosa Uwoghiren</p>
    <p className="text-xs text-muted-foreground">Founder Image Placeholder</p>
  </div>
</div>

// With this actual image:
<img 
  src="./images/fortune-founder.jpg" 
  alt="Fortune Iretiosa Uwoghiren - Founder" 
  className="w-full h-full object-cover rounded-2xl border-4 border-primary/20"
/>
```

### File Requirements:
- **Format**: JPG, PNG, or WebP
- **Size**: Recommended 400x400px or larger (square aspect ratio)
- **Quality**: High resolution for professional appearance
- **File Size**: Under 2MB for optimal loading

### After Upload:
1. Update the About.tsx file with the image code above
2. Rebuild the project: `npm run build`
3. Republish the website
